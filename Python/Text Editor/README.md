Packages required: os, sys and PyQt5

This is a text editor programmed using PyQt5(The GUI library)

The tools bar can be dragged and inserted into the window wherever you want.
It does all the basic operations like save, open, saveas, print, undo, redo, cut, copy, paste, wrap and select all.
Hope this code gives an understanding to program a basic text editor
